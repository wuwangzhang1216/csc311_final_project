# csc311_final_project

This project is about to predict student performance on multiple choice question. The given data sample is a parsed matrix where the correctness of some student i answered question j is given. The remain entries are all empty. Also, some piece of information of each student and question are given. The purpose is to predict the performance of any student answer any question.

part_a package is consist of basic machine learning algorithm. Run each .py file to see performance of each algorithm.

part_b package is the improvements of IRT algorithm. Run main.py to see performance. You may want to verify default parameter value of main function to make comparision.

Matrix completion algorithms â€“ KNN, Item Response Theory and Neural Autoencoder. Part A contains the implementation of pre-defined algorithms, while Part B involves experiments to augment and improve the algorithms implemented in Part A.
